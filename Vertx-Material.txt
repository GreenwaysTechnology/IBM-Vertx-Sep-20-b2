What is Vertx?

Eclipse Vert.x is a tool-kit for building reactive applications on the JVM.

Vertx is functional,event driven,object oriented,reactive,non blocking io and async tookit for building "distributed application - Micro service" on java virtual machine.

Vert.x is Polyglot tool kit for building micro services application.

Verx allows different programming languages can talk each other.


Polyglot means multi technology /language.

 Vertx supports Polyglot on jvm.

Does JVM support multi language(Polyglot)?

   Yes!.

2002,JCP published  specfication called "multi language" on jvm.
 
Groovy, was the first reference implementation of that spec 
Kotlin
Jython - python + java

Vetx PolyGlot

You can use Vert.x with multiple languages including Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, Groovy, Ruby and Scala.

Vert.x doesn't preach about what language is best — you choose the languages you want based on the task at hand and the skill-set of your team.

We provide idiomatic APIs for every language that Vert.x supports.


 How these languages works on jvm/
   jvm contract is only "byte code"

IO:

Hardware devices typically provide the ability to input data into the computer or output data from the computer.

To simplify the ability to support a variety of hardware devices, standardized application programming interfaces (API) are used.

Application programs use the "System Call API" to request one of a finite set of preset I/O requests from the Operating System.

The Operating System uses algorithms for processing the request that are device independent.


The Operating System uses another API to request data from the device driver.

The device driver is third party software that knows how to interact with the specific device to perform the I/O.

Sometimes we have a layering of device drivers where one device driver will call on another device driver to facilitate the I/O.

 An example of this is when devices are connected to a USB port. The driver for the device will make use of the USB device driver to facilitate passing data to and from the device.
